<h1>Housing Condo Apartment price prediction using Linear Regression</h1>

Housing price prediction is a really popular project and many people have tried to do that in many different ways already. So I decided to try it out by myself, so when I tried to find for house pricing dataset, I came across a dataset called “Bangkok Housing Condo Apartment Prices”. Since I’m currently living in Bangkok, that one got my attention but later I realized it said “Please note that the dataset provided here is a simulated dataset created for demonstration purposes, and the prices and property details do not represent actual market values.” Well anyway, let’s talk about my progress.

This code includes the following step
<h2>1. Pre-processing and analysis </h2>
